**prism** is a traditional roguelike game engine written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) for use with [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/). It utilizes the **command pattern** and **composition** to provide a modular, extensible foundation for creating turn-based games.

Released under the **MIT License**, prism is free to use for both personal and commercial projects.

## Features

- **In-game editor**: You can edit the world like a paint program during play and build prefabricated maps with Geometer.
- **Multitile actors**: Prism supports having players and monsters be NxN! No longer does a dragon need to inhabit just one tile!
- **Built-in modules**: Generic modules and systems for field of view, inventory, equipment, status effects, and more are included to get games off the ground quickly.
- **Animations**: A flexible animation system is included. Check out the [how-to](https://prismrl.github.io/prism/how-tos/animation.html) for some examples!
